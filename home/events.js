// This is the Database of Upcoming Events
// Please Edit with Care.
//
// 8 Fields (surrounded by brackets[]) are used for EACH event:
// 	["Recurring", "Month", "Day", "Year", "StartTime", "EndTime", "Name", "Description"]
// 	Each event field must be be surrounded by quotation marks followed by a comma ("",) EXCEPT the "Description" field.
//	The "Description" field is surrounded by quotation marks only ("").
//
// Each event has a comma after the closing bracket IF another event is below it on the next line down.
//	Note: The last event in this file should NOT have a comma after the closing bracket
//
// The Recurring field uses:
//	"D" = Daily; "W" = Weekly; "M" = Monthly; "Y" = Yearly; "F" = Floating Holiday
//
// One Time only events should leave the Recurring field blank
//	(ex. "")
//
// Daily events do NOT require that anything be in the Month Day and Year fields
//	Everything in the Month Day and Year fields will be ignored
//
// Weekly events should have the day of the week field set to 1 - 7
//	1=Sunday, 2=Monday, 3=Tuesday, 4=Wednesday, 5=Thurday, 6=Friday, 7=Saturday
//
// "F"loating events uses:
//	the Month field for the Month.
//	the Day field as the Cardinal Occurrence
//		1=1st, 2=2nd, 3=3rd, 4=4th, 5=5th, 6=6th occurrence of the day listed next
//	the Year field as the Day of the week the event/holiday falls on
//		1=Sunday, 2=Monday, 3=Tuesday, 4=Wednesday, 5=Thurday, 6=Friday, 7=Saturday
//	example: "F",	"1",	"3",	"2", = Floating holiday in January on the 3rd Monday of that month.
//
//	Note: Easter has it's own special formula so Please don't change anything related to Easter below
//
// "Y"early events are specific dates that never change - the Year field is ignored
//	example - Christmas is: "12","25","",
